# Stencyl-Better-Logic
#### Extension for the Stencylworks game engine that adds better logic blocks such as switch case statements and ternary operator

Stencyl currnetly lack some functionality with logic operators such as switch statements which is why I made this extension to help you devlope better games!

### Switch
![Switch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ess4654/Stencyl-Better-Logic/master/block-images/switch.png "Switch")

Sets the value to be measured using case blocks. All case blocks must reside within the switch statement.

### Case
![Case](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ess4654/Stencyl-Better-Logic/master/block-images/case.png "Case")

If the value of case matches the valued passed into switch, the code within case will be executed.

### Default
![Default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ess4654/Stencyl-Better-Logic/master/block-images/default.png "Default")

Code within this block will be executed if none of the cases match the value of the switch.

### Break
![Break](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ess4654/Stencyl-Better-Logic/master/block-images/break.png "Break")

Use between case blocks to prevent the check of further cases

### Ternary
![Ternary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ess4654/Stencyl-Better-Logic/master/block-images/ternary.png "Ternary Operator")

Useful shortcut for setting values that is faster then an if else statement. If the boolean value is true, the first value is returned otherwise the last value will be returned.
